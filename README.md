In this project I have done an Implementation of two algorithims taken from two papers on meta learning.

MAML from "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02999

Reptile from "On First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithms"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02999

These implementations are applied to the case study done in "On First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithms".
